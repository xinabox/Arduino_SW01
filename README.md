Digital (I2C) Humidity, Pressure and Temperature Sensor.
This module can be purchased on [Xinabox CC](https://xinabox.cc/modules/sensors/SW01/)

## About the SW01
The SW01 makes use of the BME280 from Bosch.This precision sensor from Bosch is the best low-cost sensing solution for measuring barometric pressure and temperature. Making use of changes in pressure allows for the measurement of alititude because pressure changes with altitude, therefore allowing it to be used as a altimeter.

More information on the BME280 can be found in the [datasheet](https://ae-bst.resource.bosch.com/media/_tech/media/datasheets/BST-BME280_DS001-11.pdf)
